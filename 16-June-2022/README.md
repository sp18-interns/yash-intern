## First Half

- ðŸ”„ Passbook Project: In Progress

### Videos

- None

### Assignment

- Had session with mentors addressing Passbook project mistakes.
  ```
   Made changes like removing seperate credit CRUD operations and putting them in transactions CRUD operations, adding {user_id} to PUT requests, using credit and debit as enums(learnt to create it in both Postgre SQL and models in Django), noted down about using pagination(didn't apply yet), started Django Project for the same, changed default db engine from sqlite3 to postgresql.
  ```

### Doubts

- None so far.
