# Django stuff:

```
- *.log # Generally, the git log is a record of commits.

- local_settings.py # settings.py is a core file in Django projects. 
It holds all the configuration values that your web app needs to work; database settings, logging configuration, where to find static files, API keys
 if you work with external APIs, and a bunch of other stuff

- db.sqlite3 # Source code: Lib/sqlite3/ SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn't require a separate
 server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
 Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage.

- db.sqlite3-journal #A DB-JOURNAL file is a temporary database file created by SQLite database management systems during a transaction 
between an application and a database.
 It contains a rollback journal, which is a temporary database that stores the most recent state of the database
