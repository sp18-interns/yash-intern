## Review of Lectures

- Lecture 8 : Object Oriented Programming

  ```
  Everything in Python is an object.
  Definition of object in Python is looser compared to other languages.
  Object can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function.
  Built-in attributes __doc__, Not all modules are stored as .py files like example, sys
  Objects are data abstraction:
      an internal representation : through data attributes. ex - Linked list as attributes of list object
      an interface for interacting with the object: through methods
  Insulation of internal representaion from outside implementation
  ```

- Lecture-9:Python Classes and Inheritance
  ```
  Object Base class - the most basic type in Python
  when instance is created __init__ is called
  Introduction to use assert statements to make sure a custom condition is not violated
  Defining operator methods(using double underscore) to enable objects for comparison operations
  Getters and Setters usage to prevent bugs from coming into play in future.
  Python not great at info hiding so using getter and setters in beneficial.
  Implementaion of Inheritance.
  OOP - Idea of creating your own collection of data where you can organize the information in avery consistent manner
  ```
