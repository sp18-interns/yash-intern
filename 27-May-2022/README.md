### Assignment

- If one model does not have an explicit reference to the other model, Django automatically adds a reverse-reference, which is by default called modelname_set. You can override this by related_name keyword on the model. For eg, Book.objects.all() and (author_object).book_set.all() in our book_outlet app.
