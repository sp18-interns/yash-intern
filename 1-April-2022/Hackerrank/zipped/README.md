### Input Format

The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
The next X lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject.

### Constraints

- 0<N<=100
- 0<X<=100

### Output Format

### Sample Input

5 3

89 90 78 93 80

90 91 85 88 86

91 92 83 89 90.5

### Sample Output

90.0

91.0

82.0

90.0

85.5

### Explanation

Marks obtained by student 1: 89,90,91
Average marks of student 1: 89+90+91= 270/3 = 90.0

Marks obtained by student 2: 90,91,92
Average marks of student 2: 90+91+92 =273/3 =91.0

Marks obtained by student 3: 78,85,83
Average marks of student 3:78+85+83 = 246/3 =82.0

Marks obtained by student 4: 93,88,89
Average marks of student 4: 93+88+89 =270/3 =90.0

Marks obtained by student 5: 80,86,90.5
Average marks of student 5: 80+86+90.5 = 256.5/3 = 85.5
