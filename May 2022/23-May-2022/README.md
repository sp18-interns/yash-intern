### Assignment

- Watched videos and practiced it.

### Doubts

- Started app using django-admin startapp(instead of manage.py startapp) and used app's name in settings.py of project directory installed apps but running server won't find the app inside project. Why? Isn't the name of the app inside installed apps in settings.py enough for django to find that app?
  Eventually,had to cut paste the app directory inside project directory and used manage.py to run server.
