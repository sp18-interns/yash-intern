- ðŸ”„ Attended Stand-Up of autoscal

### Videos

- None

### Assignment

- Had discussion with autoscal project members on choosing suitable additions for boilerplate project.
- Made changes to the forked repo and raised pull request.

### Doubts

- Did mistake by pushing on the master branch in the forked repo. Resolved by Vishal Sir by first branching out to another branch,pushing changes there and raising pull request. But, can't add reviewers as forking is done from personal repo. Need to properly understand how to use organization repo and also the processes done by Vishal Sir to undo my mistakes using revert,patch and other commands.
